# CodeExecutionPlugin
CodeExecutionPlugin means to be a simple plugin for executing code in several languages, by using either Docker or DotNETInteractive. Inspired by AutoGen.NET code execution and Kevin's Beaugrand's code plugin.

## Why I am doing this?
To learn on DotNetInteractive and use it to create something cool, that can run different types of code using DotNetInteractive and, ideally, also in a container - which could run in your computer, in the cloud or even inside a DevOps agent...
And to engage with the two creators of the source of inspiration in order to "get it done" ;)
